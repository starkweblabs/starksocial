# BUILDPLAN.md — Stark Social Media Agency
**Project:** starksocial.com Phase 2 Rebuild
**Last Updated:** April 24 2026
**Status:** 🟢 Phase 2.0 in progress

---

## Strategic Decision

**Migrating from Themeco Pro/X + Cornerstone → GeneratePress Premium + Gutenberg/GenerateBlocks**

### Why
- Mobile PageSpeed 47, LCP 9.8s — platform ceiling, not tunable
- Desktop 79, hardware masking builder bloat (149KB unused JS, 6,178KB total)
- Cornerstone export broken
- All visual CSS portable; redesign is already planned

### What Stays
- All custom PHP in `functions.php`
- Plugin logic: Gravity Forms → Perfex CRM webhook, SearchWP, BetterDocs, FacetWP
- Portfolio CPT structure + ACF Pro fields
- Barlow font stack

### What Changes
- Theme: Pro/X → GeneratePress Premium
- Builder: Cornerstone → GenerateBlocks + Gutenberg
- SEO: AIOSEO → RankMath Pro (fresh on staging)
- CSS: WPCode global → child theme `custom.css` + page-specific CSS

---

| Layer | Phase 2 |
|---|---|
| Theme | GeneratePress Premium |
| Builder | GenerateBlocks + Gutenberg |
| CSS | `custom.css` in child theme |

---

### Phase 3.3 — Stark Brand Sheet (Care Pro Feature)

**Status:** Concept / parked
**Owner:** TBD when work starts (likely new chat: `Stark — Brand Sheet`)
**Priority:** Post-launch — do NOT start until Phase 2 + first Henry Mayo Fitness site are both shipped
**Last reviewed:** April 29, 2026

---

#### What It Is

A shareable brand asset page — one URL per client. The modern replacement for the brand-PDF every brand-conscious org maintains. Client forwards the URL to printers, media outlets, ad agencies, and any vendor who needs brand assets. No login required for public assets.

Positioned as a **Stark Care Pro yearly retainer feature.** Clients on Care Pro tier get a custom branded sheet hosted by Stark. Cancel Care Pro → sheet deactivates via Perfex webhook.

#### Why It's Valuable

- **For clients:** Send one URL to a printer instead of emailing logos, hex codes, and font files separately. Looks professional. Reduces back-and-forth.
- **For vendors:** Printers, media outlets, designers get a single source. Downloadable files, copy-paste color values, no accounts.
- **For Stark:** Build once per client (~4-8 hours of client-asset prep + minor config). Strong differentiator against agencies that don't offer ongoing brand stewardship. Sticky upsell.

#### Sections (per sheet)

1. Header — client logo, last-updated date, agency contact line
2. **Logos** — each variant downloadable in SVG, PNG (transparent), JPG (white bg), EPS. Clearspace/min-size guidance shown visually.
3. **Colors** — large swatches with hex, RGB, CMYK, Pantone (where applicable). Click any value to copy to clipboard. Usage notes.
4. **Typography** — font names, downloadable .woff2/.otf, sample text in each weight, fallback guidance.
5. **Templates & graphics** — business cards, letterhead, social templates, email signature generator (ports existing Hub code).
6. **Usage guidelines** — visual do's and don'ts.
7. **Print/PDF version** — single button generates a self-contained PDF of the entire sheet for offline reference or attaching to emails. Killer feature for vendor handoff.

#### Architecture (Direction, Not Final)

**Stack:** Plain PHP. No framework, no WordPress, no DAM (ResourceSpace/Pimcore evaluated and rejected as overkill for asset volume per client).

**Per-client folder structure:**
```
brand-sheet/
├── index.php            ← renders entire page
├── config.php           ← client-specific data arrays
├── pdf.php              ← generates downloadable PDF on demand
├── signature.php        ← email signature generator (adapted from Hub)
├── assets/
│   ├── logos/
│   ├── fonts/
│   ├── templates/
│   └── images/
├── css/sheet.css
└── js/sheet.js
```

**Onboarding a new client:** Copy the folder, drop in their assets, edit `config.php`. That's the work.

**Hosting:** Each client gets their own subdomain (`brand.{client-domain}.com`) or path on Stark infrastructure (`{client-slug}.starkbrand.com`). Each install is independent — no shared infrastructure between clients, no multi-tenant database to manage.

**Perfex integration (cancellation flow):**
- Client cancels Care Pro in Perfex
- Perfex webhook fires (same mechanism as existing GF→Perfex lead webhook)
- Custom PHP endpoint flips `'active' => false` in client's `config.php`
- Page returns "Brand sheet for [Client] is currently inactive — contact agency"

#### Why Not Alternatives

- **WordPress:** Heavier than needed, Nathan prefers not to build new product surface in WordPress, no value-add for a static asset page.
- **ResourceSpace / Pimcore:** Built for thousands of assets and complex permissions. Overkill for 30-50 brand assets per client. Generic UI undermines premium positioning. Maintenance burden of running enterprise DAM per client.
- **SaaS like Brandfolder/Frontify:** Wrong economics — paying per-seat for clients defeats the productization play.

#### Definition of Done — v1 (Stark's own sheet)

- [ ] Sheet live at chosen URL (TBD — possibly `brand.starksocial.com` or `starksocial.com/brand/`)
- [ ] All 7 sections built and populated with Stark's actual assets
- [ ] Logos downloadable in SVG, PNG, JPG, EPS
- [ ] Colors with click-to-copy (hex, RGB, CMYK, Pantone)
- [ ] Email signature generator working (adapted from Hub code)
- [ ] PDF export working
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA pass

#### Definition of Done — v2 (productized for clients)

- [ ] Onboarding documented: hand-off process from Stark team to client
- [ ] Perfex webhook → deactivation flow tested end-to-end
- [ ] First paying Care Pro client onboarded (likely Henry Mayo Fitness if they take Care Pro)
- [ ] Pricing locked in for Care Pro tier (Nathan decision)
- [ ] Marketing page on starksocial.com explaining the Care Pro brand sheet feature

#### Out of Scope (Forever or for Later)

- Client-editable interface (clients send updates to Stark, Stark updates the sheet)
- Asset versioning UI (Git history is sufficient)
- Analytics dashboard for clients (could be added later if requested)
- Multi-tenant single install (intentionally rejected — independent installs are simpler)
- AI-powered metadata or search (not needed at this asset volume)

#### Decisions Log

- **April 29, 2026 — Use case clarified:** Primary value is vendor handoff (printers, media outlets) not internal brand documentation. Drives the "shareable URL + PDF export" framing.
- **April 29, 2026 — Stack decision:** Plain PHP. WordPress and DAM platforms (ResourceSpace, Pimcore) evaluated and rejected.
- **April 29, 2026 — Productization model:** Care Pro yearly retainer feature, not a standalone SaaS. Cancellation = deactivation via Perfex webhook.
- **April 29, 2026 — Timing:** Parked. Do not start until Phase 2 + first Henry Mayo Fitness site are shipped.

## Navigation Structure (Locked)

**Desktop:** Transparent on load → slim frosted glass on scroll
**Mobile:** Same transition, burger → full screen dark glass overlay

**Primary nav (5 items):**
- Work (portfolio)
- Services (mega menu, 2×4 grid)
- Blog
- Podcast
- Contact

**Services mega menu:**
```
Social Media Mgmt     Paid Advertising
Web Design            SEO
Content Creation      Brand Strategy
Audit & Consulting    Fractional CMO

```

**Utility (top right):** Support · Client Portal
**Mobile services:** Accordion expand inline, no Back button

## Notes

- BetterDocs default styles dequeued in `functions.php`; styling in `custom.css`
- Gravity Forms default styles dequeued
- Podcast scripts conditionally loaded only on podcast pages
- Blog rewrites: `/blog/` + `/blog/page/N/` via `add_rewrite_rule`
- Podlove DB tables: `wp_podlove_episode` queried directly in `starkpodmeta`
- Mobile smooth scroll: kill CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth`; JS does programmatic scroll with touch interrupts


## Style Guide Page

**Status:** Not started
**Owner:** `Stark — Style Guide` chat (page rendering, sections), `Stark — Copy` chat (written sections)
**Priority:** Build alongside Phase 2 — used as live design reference during development; pitched to prospects (Henry Mayo Fitness) ASAP
**Scope:** Single page, Stark's own brand system, components rendered from production CSS, deployed in two phases

---

### Purpose

Dual-purpose deliverable:

1. **Internal tool** — single source of truth for design tokens and components. Build chat references it when porting CSS. Copy chat references it for voice/tone consistency.
2. **Sales artifact** — public-facing demonstration of brand rigor. Primary use case: Henry Mayo Fitness pitch. Secondary: linked from portfolio case studies, used in all future pitches. Long-term: prototype for productized client style guide offering (post-Phase 2).

---

### Build Sequence (Two Phases)

This page is built **twice** by design: once on the current site, then ported when Phase 2 launches.

#### Phase A — Current site (Themeco Pro/X + Cornerstone)

- **Live URL:** `starksocial.com/style-guide`
- **Built using:** Cornerstone elements + custom CSS via WPCode + PHP where needed
- **Why first:** Henry Mayo Fitness pitch is imminent. Need a polished live URL to send prospects faster than waiting for Phase 2 launch.
- **Tokens:** Pull from current site's CSS variables wherever possible

#### Phase B — Phase 2 site (GeneratePress + GenerateBlocks)

- **Live URL:** `staging.starksocial.com/style-guide` during dev; replaces Phase A at `starksocial.com/style-guide` at Phase 2 launch
- **Built using:** GenerateBlocks page template (or `page-style-guide.php` in `stark-social/` child theme), pulling from Phase 2's `:root` token system
- **Components:** Embedded as-is from production `stark-social/` theme — no reimplementation
- **Goal:** Feature parity with Phase A, but cleaner architecture using Phase 2 tokens

---

### Lockdown Mechanism

- **STYLEGUIDE.md** in repo = written canonical source (rationale, rules, decisions)
- **`/style-guide/` page** = visual rendering, pulls from live CSS variables via JS at render time
- **Components on the page** = production components, not copies
- **Drift = structurally impossible** because there's one source of CSS

---

### Page Sections (in order, both phases)

1. **Brand foundation**
   - Logo (primary, secondary, monogram if exists)
   - Clearspace and minimum sizing
   - Voice summary (3–4 sentences, links to VOICE-GUIDE.md)

2. **Color system**
   - Swatches rendered from CSS custom properties
   - Each swatch shows: hex, RGB, CSS variable name, usage notes
   - Includes: primary, secondary, neutrals, semantic (success/warning/error), surface tokens

3. **Typography**
   - Live type scale rendered in production font stack (Barlow + Barlow Condensed)
   - Display, H1–H6, body, small, caption
   - Each shows: font family, weight, size, line-height, letter-spacing, CSS variable name
   - Pairing examples (heading + body together)

4. **Spacing & layout**
   - Spacing scale (rendered as visual blocks)
   - Grid system
   - Breakpoints with annotations
   - Container max-widths

5. **Components**
   - Buttons (all variants × all states: default, hover, active, focus, disabled)
   - Form fields (input, textarea, select, checkbox, radio, with all states)
   - Cards (variants used across the site)
   - Navigation states (transparent, frosted, mobile accordion — live demo)
   - Scroll progress bar (live demo in contained section)
   - A11y + back-to-top choreography (live demo)

6. **Motion principles**
   - Easing curves used
   - Duration tokens
   - When to animate, when not to

7. **Code standards**
   - CSS naming conventions
   - File organization
   - Comments and documentation expectations

### Definition of Done — Phase A (Current Site)

- [ ] Page live at `starksocial.com/style-guide`
- [ ] All seven sections built and populated
- [ ] All color tokens rendered from CSS custom properties
- [ ] All typography rendered in production Barlow stack with correct tokens
- [ ] All component states represented and interactive where applicable
- [ ] Scroll progress bar and nav transformation working as live demos
- [ ] Page passes WCAG 2.1 AA
- [ ] Page indexed in RankMath/AIOSEO with appropriate schema (coordinate with SEO chat)
- [ ] Linked from portfolio + footer (Nathan decides placement)
- [ ] STYLEGUIDE.md updated to reference page as visual companion
- [ ] Pitch-ready: linkable in proposals to Henry Mayo Fitness and other prospects

### Definition of Done — Phase B (Phase 2 Port)

- [ ] Page rebuilt on staging at `staging.starksocial.com/style-guide`
- [ ] Built using Phase 2 `:root` token system from `stark-social/` child theme
- [ ] All components are production Phase 2 components, not copies
- [ ] Feature parity with Phase A version (or improved)
- [ ] Phase 2 PageSpeed targets met (85+ mobile, 95+ desktop)
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA passes on Phase 2 build
- [ ] Replaces Phase A version at `starksocial.com/style-guide` at Phase 2 launch
- [ ] Old Phase A code removed cleanly

---

### Working Workflow

- As `Stark — Build` chat creates each component for Phase 2, the `Stark — Style Guide` chat adds it to the Phase 2 style guide page (Phase B build)
- Style guide page becomes the integration test — if a component looks wrong on the guide, it's wrong on the site
- `Stark — Copy` chat reviews written sections (voice, brand foundation, code standards intros) once components are in place
- `Stark — QA` chat audits the guide page during the Phase 2 QA pass (accessibility, schema, PageSpeed)

---

### Out of Scope for v1 (both phases)

- Client-editable version
- Multi-tenant / per-client style guides (productized offering — separate scope, after Phase 2)
- Downloadable assets (logo zip, font files) — can be added in v1.1 if Henry Mayo conversation requires it
- Versioning UI (v1.0, v1.1 history) — handled in Git commits

---

### Decisions Log

- **April 29, 2026 — Build sequence:** Phase A on current Themeco/Cornerstone site first, Phase B port to GeneratePress before Phase 2 launch. Decided in favor of speed-to-pitch over single-build efficiency.
- **April 29, 2026 — Ownership:** Dedicated `Stark — Style Guide` chat owns this deliverable across both phases. Build chat focuses on Phase 2 site overall.
- **April 29, 2026 — Sales context:** Primary prospect = Henry Mayo Fitness. Style guide is the wedge against an expensive, unresponsive incumbent vertical marketing company.
