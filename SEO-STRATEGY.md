## Target Markets (Local SEO)

| Market | Region | Notes |

| San Fernando Valley | LA County | Closest to base, most competitive |
| Antelope Valley | LA County (north) | Underserved, low competition |
| Ventura County | Ventura | Strong SMB market |
| Bakersfield | Kern County | Very underserved, high opportunity |

### Strategy Per Market
- Dedicated landing page per market (not thin — genuine local value)
- `LocalBusiness` schema with `areaServed` per region
- Local testimonials/case studies referenced per page where possible
- Google Business Profile service areas set to all 4 markets
- Internal linking: service pages → local landing pages
